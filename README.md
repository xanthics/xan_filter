This is a script to generate a filter file for Path of Exile using the included config files.

Usage
=====
Run setup.py first to install all requirements.txt modules

Edit gen_always_highlight_currency.py (optional) in the first function with your account name, currency tab index, and POESESSID to have the filter tailor some highlighting to your account.

Run Create_filter with necessary config files to generate xan.filter.  Note that this will automatically put xan.show.filter and xan.hide.filter in <relative path>\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile

~~(Optional) Run pricetool to update currency, divination, essence, and unique tiers.  The poe ninja version should finish very quickly~~  

Config
======
See item_config.template.py and theme_config.minimal.py

Hide all
