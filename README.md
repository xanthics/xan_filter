# poe_filter

This is a simple script to generate a filter file for Path of Exile using the included config files.

Usage
=====
Run Create_filter with necessary config files to generate xan.filter

Config
======
See template.py

Hide all
========
![Hide unspecified items](images/hide.png?raw=true "Hide")

Show all
========
![Show all items](images/show.png?raw=true "Show")


To-Do
=====
No ETA

Add leveling gear

Add crafting bases

Add "best of the zone" highlighting.

Expand uniques filtering

Add rare highlighting based on drop level/item level

Add config processor that created compact output

No ETA: I work on this when I'm bored of releveling toons or farming.

Thanks

This script is heavily inspired by the discontinued "One Filter to rule them all"
